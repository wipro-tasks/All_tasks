		* Upcasting: Upcasting is the typecasting of a child object to a parent object. 
		 * Upcasting can be done implicitly. Upcasting gives us the flexibility to access the 
		 * parent class members 
		 * but it is not possible to access all the child class members using this feature. 
		 * Instead of all the members, we can access some specified members of the child class.
		 *  For instance, we can access the overridden methods.
		Downcasting: Similarly, downcasting means the typecasting of a parent object to a 
		child object. 
		Downcasting cannot be implicit. If it s not possible, the compiler throws a 
		ClassCastException.
