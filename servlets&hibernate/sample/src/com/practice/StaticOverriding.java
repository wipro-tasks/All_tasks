/*
 * Can we override a static method?
No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on 
dynamic binding at runtime 
and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time.
 So, we cannot override static methods.

The calling of method depends upon the type of object that calls the 
static method. It means:

--If we call a static method by using the parent class object, the original 
static method will be called 
from the parent class.
--If we call a static method by using the child class object, 
the static method of the child class will be 
called.
