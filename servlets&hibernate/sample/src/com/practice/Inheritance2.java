//Object is the super classes for all the classes in java!

 * Imagine you're building a house (object).
The parent class lays the foundation (constructor), and the child class adds the upper floors.
But you can't build the upper floors unless the foundation is already there.

That�s why Java forces the child to call the parent constructor first.
