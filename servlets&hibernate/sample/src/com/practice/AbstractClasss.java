/*
 * There are two ways to achieve or implement abstraction in java program. 
 * They are as follows:

Abstract class (0 to 100%)
Interface (100%)
 */
/*
 * A concrete class cannot contain an abstract method. An abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods.
 * A concrete class is a subclass of an abstract class, which implements all its abstract method. 
 
Abstract methods cannot have body. 
 
Abstract class can have static fields and static method, like other classes. 
 
An abstract class cannot be declared as final. 
 
Only abstract class can have abstract methods. 
 
A private, final, static method cannot be abstract, as it cannot be overridden in a subclass. 
 
Abstract class cannot have abstract constructors. 
 
Abstract class cannot have abstract static methods. 
 
If a class extends an abstract class, then it should define all the abstract methods (override) of the base abstract class. 
If not, the subclass(the class extending abstract class) must also be defined as abstract class. 
 *

/*
 * Abstract Class							Interface
Like a template with some built-in tools	Like a blueprint with no tools
You inherit both design and some features	You inherit just the design/requirements
*/
 
/*
 * Use interfaces when: you only need to define what should be done.

Use abstract classes when: you need to share common code + define rules.

 * | Feature              | **Interface**                                        | **Abstract Class**                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | A contract that defines **what a class must do**     | A base class that defines **what a class is + shared code** |
| **Inheritance**      | Supports **multiple inheritance**                    | Only **single inheritance**                                 |
| **Methods**          | Only abstract methods (until Java 7)                 | Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods             |
| **Default Methods**  | From Java 8: supports `default` and `static` methods | No `default`, but concrete methods are allowed              |
| **Access Modifiers** | Methods are `public abstract` by default             | Can use `public`, `protected`, `private`                    |
| **Constructors**     | ❌ Cannot have constructors                           | ✅ Can have constructors                                     |
| **Fields/Variables** | Only `public static final` (constants)               | Can have instance variables (normal fields)                 |
| **Use Case**         | To define **capabilities/behavior** (what it can do) | To define **base class with shared code**                   |
| **Speed**            | Slightly faster to load                              | Slightly slower due to more structure                       |
